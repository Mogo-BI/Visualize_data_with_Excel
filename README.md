# Visualize_data_with_Excel

<h1>Context</h1>

Following many departures, 'Primero Bank' company mandated us to carry out a data processing of her commercial management software.

That data analysis had to allow to identify the common characteristics to customers who have left their establishment.

It also had to allow to identify the proportion of customers who could leave the bank in the future.

Thereby, they could put in place an action plan in order to avoid a new wave of departures.
